The `document_loaders` directory is for integration tests of various document loaders in the `langchain` codebase. The tests cover different loaders, including ArxivLoader, BigQueryLoader, BiliBiliLoader, BlockchainDocumentLoader, ConfluenceLoader, DataFrameLoader, DuckDBLoader, OutlookMessageLoader, FacebookChatLoader, FigmaFileLoader, GitbookLoader, IFixitLoader, JSONLoader, MastodonLoader, ModernTreasuryLoader, UnstructuredODTLoader, various PDF loaders, PythonLoader, SitemapLoader, SlackLoader, SpreedlyLoader, StripeLoader, UnstructuredAPIFileLoader, UnstructuredAPIFileIOLoader, UnstructuredURLLoader, Playwright URLLoader, and WhatsAppChatLoader. The tests ensure that the loaders can successfully load documents and extract metadata and content.

Additional Summary:
The `document_loaders` directory also includes a `parsers` subdirectory for testing various PDF parsers, including PyMuPDF, PyPDF, PDFMiner, PyPDFium2, and PDFPlumber, to ensure that they can correctly load and parse a PDF document.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file contains integration tests for document loaders.

#### test_arxiv.py
This file contains integration tests for the ArxivLoader class, which loads documents from the arXiv repository. The tests ensure that the loader returns the expected number of documents, with the expected metadata and content. The tests also cover scenarios where no documents are returned, and where all available metadata is loaded.

#### test_bigquery.py
This file contains integration tests for the BigQueryLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders.bigquery module. The tests check that the loader can load data from BigQuery and correctly parse it into documents with page content and metadata.

#### test_bilibili.py
This file contains an integration test for the BiliBiliLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders module. The test checks that the loader can successfully load documents from Bilibili URLs, and that the loaded documents have the expected metadata and content.

#### test_blockchain.py
This file contains integration tests for the `BlockchainDocumentLoader` class, which checks the `load()` method's functionality. The tests cover the expected number of NFTs for a valid contract, pagination, and contracts on the Polygon network. Additionally, the tests check for errors and runtime errors and are skipped if the Alchemy API key is not provided.

#### test_confluence.py
This file contains integration tests for the ConfluenceLoader class in the langchain/document_loaders/confluence.py file. The tests check if the loader can load a single Confluence page, a full Confluence space, and handle pagination. The tests also check if the loader can pass Confluence-specific arguments.

#### test_dataframe.py
This file contains integration tests for the `DataFrameLoader` class in the `document_loaders` module. The tests check that the `load` method returns a list of `Document` objects, that the metadata is correctly extracted from the DataFrame columns, and that the `page_content` attribute of the `Document` objects is set correctly.

#### test_duckdb.py
This file contains three test functions for the DuckDBLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders.duckdb_loader module. The tests check the functionality of the load method with different options for page content and metadata columns. If DuckDB is not installed, the tests are skipped.

#### test_email.py
This file contains an integration test for the OutlookMessageLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders module. The test loads an example email message file and asserts that the loader returns the expected metadata and page content.

#### test_facebook_chat.py
This file contains a single test function for the FacebookChatLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders module. The test checks that the loader can successfully load a JSON file and that the loaded document matches the expected content.

#### test_sitemap.py
This file contains integration tests for the SitemapLoader class in the document_loaders module. The tests cover retrieving documents and metadata from a sitemap, filtering URLs, and working with different blocksize and blocknum parameters.

#### test_slack.py
This file contains integration tests for the Slack directory loader. The tests ensure that the loader can successfully load documents from a Slack export file and that workspace URLs are correctly passed through in the metadata of the loaded documents.

#### test_spreedly.py
This file contains an integration test for the SpreedlyLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders.spreedly module. The test checks if the load method of the SpreedlyLoader class returns a list of documents with length 1, given an access token and a resource.

#### test_stripe.py
This file contains an integration test for the StripeLoader class in the langchain.document_loaders.stripe module. The test ensures that the StripeLoader correctly loads a single document from the "charges" endpoint.

#### test_unstructured.py
This file contains integration tests for the UnstructuredAPIFileLoader and UnstructuredAPIFileIOLoader classes in the langchain.document_loaders module. The tests ensure that the loaders can successfully load unstructured documents in various formats, including PDF and text files, and can handle multiple documents using a fast loading strategy and element mode.

#### test_url.py
This file contains two integration tests for the `UnstructuredURLLoader` class in the `document_loaders` module. The first test checks that an exception is not raised when `continue_on_failure` is set to `True`. The second test checks that an exception is raised when `continue_on_failure` is set to `False`.

#### test_url_playwright.py
This file contains an integration test for the Playwright URL loader. The test checks if the loader can successfully load documents from a list of URLs while removing specific selectors and running in headless mode.

#### test_whatsapp_chat.py
This file contains a single test function that tests the `WhatsAppChatLoader` class from the `langchain.document_loaders` module. The test loads a sample WhatsApp chat file and checks if the loader returns the expected document content.

### Directories
#### parsers
The `parsers` directory is for testing various PDF parsers, including PyMuPDF, PyPDF, PDFMiner, PyPDFium2, and PDFPlumber, to ensure that they can correctly load and parse a PDF document.
