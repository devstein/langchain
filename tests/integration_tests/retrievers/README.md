The `retrievers` directory is for integration tests of various classes related to document retrieval, including ArxivRetriever, AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever, ContextualCompressionRetriever, TFIDFRetriever, WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever, and WikipediaRetriever. The tests ensure that the retrievers can successfully retrieve relevant documents for a given query, both synchronously and asynchronously, and that they behave correctly when given invalid queries.

### Files
#### test_arxiv.py
This file contains integration tests for the ArxivRetriever class, which retrieves documents from the Arxiv API. The tests ensure that documents are returned with the expected metadata and content, and that the retriever behaves correctly when given invalid queries.

#### test_azure_cognitive_search.py
This file contains integration tests for the `AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever` class, which is a wrapper for the Azure Cognitive Search API. The tests ensure that the retriever can successfully retrieve relevant documents for a given query, both synchronously and asynchronously.

#### test_contextual_compression.py
This file contains a test for the `ContextualCompressionRetriever` class's `get_relevant_docs` method. The test creates a `ContextualCompressionRetriever` object and tests if the method returns the expected number of relevant documents.

#### test_tfidf.py
This file contains two test functions for the `TFIDFRetriever` class in the `langchain.retrievers.tfidf` module. The first test checks that the `from_texts` method correctly initializes the retriever's `docs` and `tfidf_array` attributes. The second test checks that the `from_texts` method correctly applies the specified `tfidf_params` to the retriever's `tfidf_array`.

#### test_weaviate_hybrid_search.py
This file contains integration tests for the `WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever` class. It tests the functionality of the `get_relevant_documents` method by adding documents to the retriever, applying a filter, and checking if the output matches the expected order.

### Directories
#### document_compressors
The `document_compressors` directory is for integration tests of various classes related to document compression and filtering, including LLMChainExtractor, LLMChainFilter, CohereRerank, and EmbeddingsFilter. The tests ensure that the classes compress and filter documents correctly, and initialize correctly where applicable.
