The `memory` directory is for integration tests of different message stores with the `ConversationBufferMemory` class from the `langchain.memory` module. The tests add messages to the message stores, retrieve them, and check if they are in the expected format. Finally, the tests clear the message history to prepare for the next test run. The message stores tested include Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB, Firestore, MongoDB, and Redis.

### Files
#### test_cassandra.py
This file contains a test for using Cassandra as a message store with the ConversationBufferMemory class from the langchain.memory module. It sets up a CassandraChatMessageHistory and adds messages to it, then checks that the messages can be retrieved and are in the expected format. Finally, it clears the message history to prepare for the next test run.

#### test_cosmos_db.py
This file contains a test for using Azure Cosmos DB as a message store with the `ConversationBufferMemory` class from the `langchain.memory` module. The test sets up a `CosmosDBChatMessageHistory` instance and adds messages to it using the `ConversationBufferMemory` instance. It then checks that the messages were added correctly and clears the message history.

#### test_firestore.py
This file contains a test for the `ConversationBufferMemory` class using `FirestoreChatMessageHistory` as the chat message history. The test adds some messages to the chat history, retrieves them, and checks if they are as expected. Finally, it clears the chat history.

#### test_mongodb.py
This file contains a test for using MongoDB as a message store with the `ConversationBufferMemory` class from the `langchain.memory` module. The test sets up a MongoDBChatMessageHistory instance, adds messages to it, retrieves the message history from the memory store, and checks that the messages are present in the JSON representation of the message history. Finally, the test clears the record from the MongoDB instance.

#### test_redis.py
This file contains a test for the `ConversationBufferMemory` class using Redis as a message store. The test sets up a `RedisChatMessageHistory` instance, adds some messages to it, and then retrieves the message history from the memory store and converts it to JSON. Finally, it asserts that the added messages are present in the JSON and clears the record from Redis.
