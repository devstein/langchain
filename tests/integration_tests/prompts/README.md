The `prompts` directory is for integration tests of the `NGramOverlapExampleSelector` class, which tests its ability to select examples based on ngram overlap scores, add new examples, and set the threshold to 0.0. It also includes tests for cases where the threshold is greater than 1.0 and for the accuracy of the `ngram_overlap_score` function.
