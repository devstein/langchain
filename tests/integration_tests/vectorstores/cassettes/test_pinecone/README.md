The `test_pinecone` directory is for storing YAML-encoded cassettes that contain integration tests for various functions in the Pinecone vector store, including `test_from_texts`, `test_from_texts_with_metadatas`, and `test_from_texts_with_scores`. These tests involve sending requests to the OpenAI API and verifying the responses, as well as testing the functionality of creating a Pinecone index from a list of texts with associated scores.
