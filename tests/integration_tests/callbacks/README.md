The `callbacks` directory is for integration tests of the `callbacks` module in the `langchain` repository. The tests include verifying the functionality of the `LANGCHAIN_SESSION` environment variable and testing the `get_openai_callback` function with the OpenAI language model.

### Files
#### test_langchain_tracer.py
This file contains integration tests for the `langchain.callbacks.tracing_enabled` module. The tests check if tracing is enabled for the session using OpenAI to answer a set of questions. The tests also verify the functionality of the `LANGCHAIN_SESSION` environment variable by checking if it is set and deleting it if it exists. Additionally, the file includes tests that use asyncio and a context manager to enable tracing for multiple tasks and a single task, respectively.

#### test_openai_callback.py
This file contains integration tests for the `get_openai_callback` function in the `callbacks` module. The tests ensure that the callback function returns the expected number of tokens and cost when used with the OpenAI language model. It also includes a test for the `initialize_agent` function in the `agents` module, which uses the `get_openai_callback` function.
