The `tracers` directory is for unit tests of the tracers used in LangChain. The tests cover various scenarios such as handling Chain runs, Tool runs, and nested runs, recording errors, and creating `Run` objects with different parameters. The purpose of the tests is to ensure that the tracers can properly trace the execution of LangChain and record relevant information.
