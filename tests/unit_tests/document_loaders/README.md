The `document_loaders` directory is for unit tests and example data related to document loaders for various file formats. It includes tests for loading HTML, CSV, Evernote, Telegram, and YouTube documents, as well as tests for detecting file encodings and parsers used in the Langchain codebase. Additionally, the directory contains sample documents and test data for loading documents with different structures and contents.

### Files
#### test_base.py
This file contains a unit test for the BaseBlobParser class in the langchain.document_loaders.base module. The test verifies that the lazy method is hooked up to the eager method by default, and that a single document is returned.

#### test_confluence.py
This file contains unit tests for the `ConfluenceLoader` class, covering initialization with valid and invalid arguments, loading data by page and space IDs, and ensuring correct document content. It also tests for raising `ValueError` when required parameters are not specified and checks that certain Confluence API calls are not made. Additionally, it includes a function that returns mock page restrictions for the loader.

#### test_csv_loader.py
This file contains unit tests for the CSVLoader class, including its ability to handle valid data, empty files, files with only one row, and CSV files with only one column. It also includes a utility function to get the CSV file path.

#### test_detect_encoding.py
This file contains unit tests for the `detect_file_encodings` function in the `helpers` module of the `document_loaders` package. The tests include checking for the correct number of files loaded and raising errors for certain conditions.

#### test_json_loader.py
This file contains unit tests for the JSONLoader class, which tests its ability to load valid and invalid JSON content, and raise errors when necessary. The tests use the pytest framework and the mocker fixture to simulate file input.

#### test_psychic.py
This file contains unit tests for the `PsychicLoader` class, which is responsible for loading data from the PsychicAPI. The tests cover the initialization of the loader and the loading of data, ensuring that the correct documents are returned and that they are of the `Document` class.

### Directories
#### blob_loaders
The `blob_loaders` directory is for unit tests of the `Blob` class and its methods in the `schema.py` file. The tests cover initializing a `Blob` object with binary data, reading a blob from a file path, and reading a blob from a string path. Additionally, the tests include mimetype inference based on options and path, blob initialization validation, and a simple test that verifies that a blob loader can be implemented.

#### loaders
The `loaders` directory is for storing unit tests and test data related to the document loaders in the `langchain.document_loaders` module.

#### parsers
The `parsers` directory is for unit tests of parsers used in the Langchain codebase, including tests for the `MimeTypeBasedParser` class, BS4HTMLParser class, and PDF parsers such as PyPDF, PDFMiner, PyMuPDF, and PyPDFium2. The tests verify that the parsers can correctly extract metadata and content from various file types and that the public API of the parsers is correctly listed.

#### sample_documents
The `sample_documents` directory is for storing sample Evernote notes and notebooks in ENEX format, including empty notes, notes with missing content tags, and notes with media attachments.

#### test_docs
The `test_docs` directory is for storing sample chat conversations and CSV files used as test data for loading documents with different structures and contents.
