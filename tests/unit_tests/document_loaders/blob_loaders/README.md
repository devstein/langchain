The `blob_loaders` directory is for unit tests of the `Blob` class and its methods in the `schema.py` file. The tests cover initializing a `Blob` object with binary data, reading a blob from a file path, and reading a blob from a string path. Additionally, the tests include mimetype inference based on options and path, blob initialization validation, and a simple test that verifies that a blob loader can be implemented.
