The `parsers` directory is for unit tests of parsers used in the Langchain codebase, including tests for the `MimeTypeBasedParser` class, BS4HTMLParser class, and PDF parsers such as PyPDF, PDFMiner, PyMuPDF, and PyPDFium2. The tests verify that the parsers can correctly extract metadata and content from various file types and that the public API of the parsers is correctly listed.

### Files
#### test_generic.py
This file contains unit tests for the `MimeTypeBasedParser` class in the `generic` module. The tests check that the parser can extract the first, second, and third characters of a blob for `text/plain` and `text/html` mimetypes respectively, and that a `ValueError` is raised when the mimetype is not supported. The test also checks that the fallback parser is used when the mimetype is not found.

#### test_pdf_parsers.py
This file contains unit tests for PDF parsers used in the Langchain codebase, including PyPDF, PDFMiner, PyMuPDF, and PyPDFium2. The tests verify that the parsers can correctly split PDFs by page, extract page content and metadata, and parse documents without errors.

#### test_public_api.py
This file contains a unit test for the public API of the parsers in the `document_loaders.parsers` module. The test ensures that the `__all__` variable correctly lists the available parsers and that any changes to the public API are caught.
