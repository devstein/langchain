The `file_management` directory is for unit tests of various tools related to file management. These tools include copying, searching, listing, moving, reading, and writing files within a specified root directory. The tests ensure that the tools can perform their intended functions correctly, handle errors appropriately, and validate file paths. The tests also cover cases where the root directory is not specified and where attempts are made to access files outside of the allowed directory.
