The `tools` directory is for unit testing various tools in the `langchain` library. It includes tests for the `BaseTool` class and its subclasses, `JsonSpec`, `Zapier`, `PythonREPLTool`, `PythonAstREPLTool`, `RequestsGetTool`, `RequestsPostTool`, `RequestsPatchTool`, `RequestsPutTool`, and `RequestsDeleteTool`. The directory also contains subdirectories for testing file management, OpenAPI specifications, PowerBI tools, and shell commands. The tests ensure that the tools perform their intended functions correctly, handle errors appropriately, and validate inputs and outputs.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file contains the test suite for the `tools` module.

#### test_base.py
This file contains unit tests for the `BaseTool` class and its subclasses. It tests the functionality of the `tool` decorator, structured arguments, and raises an exception when a `BaseTool` without type hints is used.

#### test_signatures.py
This file contains unit tests for the `BaseTool` class and its non-abstract subclasses. The tests ensure that all tools defined in the repository accept a run manager argument.

#### test_zapier.py
This file contains unit tests for the Zapier tool. It tests the default and custom prompts for the tool, as well as validating an invalid custom prompt.

### Directories
#### file_management
The `file_management` directory is for unit tests of various tools related to file management. These tools include copying, searching, listing, moving, reading, and writing files within a specified root directory. The tests ensure that the tools can perform their intended functions correctly, handle errors appropriately, and validate file paths. The tests also cover cases where the root directory is not specified and where attempts are made to access files outside of the allowed directory.

#### openapi
The `openapi` directory is for testing and storing OpenAPI specifications and related classes. It includes unit tests for the `APIOperation` and `APIRequestBody` classes, as well as various YAML and JSON files that define the available paths, operations, parameters, and responses for each API. The directory also contains subdirectories for each API, including `robot`, `klarna`, `schooldigger`, `urlbox`, and `zapier`, among others.

#### powerbi
The `powerbi` directory is for unit testing the powerbi tools of the `langchain` library. It contains a single file `test_powerbi.py` that checks if the powerbi tools can be imported without any errors. This ensures that users of the library will not face any import errors while loading powerbi related code if they don't have optional dependencies installed.

#### python
The `python` directory is for unit testing the Python REPL tools, `PythonREPLTool` and `PythonAstREPLTool`, including version requirements for `PythonAstREPLTool`. The tests cover various functionalities such as running single input, printing output, raising exceptions, and returning values. Additionally, there is a test for the `sanitize_input` function, which removes unnecessary characters from a code snippet.

#### requests
The `requests` directory is for unit testing the `langchain.tools.requests.tool` module. It includes tests for the `_parse_input` function and the `RequestsGetTool`, `RequestsPostTool`, `RequestsPatchTool`, `RequestsPutTool`, and `RequestsDeleteTool` classes. The tests ensure that the tools return the expected responses for different types of HTTP requests using the `requests` library.

#### shell
The `shell` directory is for unit testing the `ShellTool` class in the `langchain.tools.shell.tool` module. The tests cover input validation, initialization, and running shell commands synchronously and asynchronously. Test data is provided in the form of a list of shell commands.
