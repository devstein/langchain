The `urlbox` directory is for storing the OpenAPI specification file (`apispec.json`) for the Urlbox API. This file contains information on the API's endpoints, request and response schemas, error handling, and security scheme. It defines the expected input parameters for rendering a webpage as an image or video, including the URL or raw HTML to render, viewport dimensions, ad and cookie banner blocking, and other rendering options.
