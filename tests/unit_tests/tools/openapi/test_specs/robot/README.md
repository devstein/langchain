The `robot` directory is for storing OpenAPI specifications for the `robot` tool's API endpoints. The `apispec.yaml` file contains schemas for various objects and definitions, including parameters, responses, and descriptions for multiple endpoints such as `/ask_for_passphrase`, `/get_state`, `/goto/{x}/{y}/{z}`, `Goto`, `Recycle`, and `Walk`. It also includes the schema for successful and error responses for unit testing.
