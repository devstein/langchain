The `schooldigger` directory is for storing the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file (`apispec.json`) for the SchoolDigger API V2.0. This file contains detailed information on various endpoints, parameters, and responses for searching and retrieving data on over 120,000 schools and 18,500 districts in the U.S. It also includes JSON schema definitions for objects such as `APIDistrict`, `APILocation`, and `APICounty`, which define the structure and properties of SchoolDigger school and district data.
