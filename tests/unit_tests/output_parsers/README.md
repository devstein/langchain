The `output_parsers` directory is for unit tests and modules related to parsing output from various sources, including structured output, regular expressions, and Pydantic models. It contains tests for the `BaseOutputParser` class and its subclasses, as well as tests for specific parsers such as `BooleanOutputParser`, `CommaSeparatedListOutputParser`, `RegexDictParser`, and `PydanticOutputParser`. The directory also includes a test for the `CombiningOutputParser` class, which combines the output of multiple parsers.
