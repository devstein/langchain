The `client` directory is for unit tests of the LangChainPlusClient class and related functions, including testing link splitting, API key validation, CSV file uploading, message and prompt handling methods, and the `arun_on_dataset` and `run_llm` methods. It also includes tests for the `runner_utils` module's `_get_messages` and `_get_prompts` functions, as well as the `run_llm` function.

### Files
#### test_langchain.py
This file contains unit tests for the LangChain+ client, including tests for splitting links, checking if a URL is localhost, validating an API key if hosted, verifying headers, uploading a CSV file, and testing the `arun_on_dataset` function. The tests use the mock library to simulate API responses and monkeypatching to mock the `read_dataset` function.

#### test_runner_utils.py
This file contains unit tests for the `runner_utils` module's `_get_messages` and `_get_prompts` functions, as well as the `run_llm` function. The tests cover valid and invalid inputs to ensure the functions handle them correctly.
