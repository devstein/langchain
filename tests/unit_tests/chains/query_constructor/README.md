The `query_constructor` directory is for unit testing the LLM-generated structured query parsing. It includes tests for parsing invalid grammar, comparison, and operation, as well as nested operations and different types of values such as integers, floats, lists, and strings. It also contains a unit test for the `parse_bool_value` function in the `query_constructor` module.
