The `data` directory is for storing files and subdirectories related to data used in unit tests. It includes a `prompt_file.txt` file that contains a template for a question and answer prompt, and a `prompts` directory that stores JSON files defining prompts with input variables.

### Files
#### prompt_file.txt
This file, `prompt_file.txt`, contains a template for a question and answer prompt. The template includes a placeholder for the question and a blank space for the answer.

### Directories

The directory contains files for prompts with extra arguments, missing arguments, and simple prompts with one input variable.
