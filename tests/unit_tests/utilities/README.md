The `utilities` directory is for unit tests and utility functions related to GraphQL and loading data from a hub path or URL. It includes tests for the `GraphQLAPIWrapper` class and GraphQL utility functions in `graphql.py`, as well as tests for the `try_load_from_hub` function in `loading.py`.

### Files
#### test_graphql.py
This file contains unit tests for the `GraphQLAPIWrapper` class and GraphQL utility functions in the `graphql.py` module of the `utilities` package. It includes a mock GraphQL response and a test for the `run` method.

#### test_loading.py
This file contains unit tests for the `try_load_from_hub` function in `langchain.utilities.loading`. The tests cover scenarios such as loading from a non-hub path, loading from a hub path with an invalid prefix or suffix, and loading from a valid hub path with and without a ref. The function is also tested to ensure it correctly loads file contents from a given URL and raises an error if the request fails.
