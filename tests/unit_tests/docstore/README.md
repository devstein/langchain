The `docstore` directory is for unit testing the `DocstoreFn` and `InMemoryDocstore` classes. The tests cover scenarios such as finding a document, adding a new document, and handling errors when adding a document with an existing ID.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file contains the initialization code for the `docstore` directory's unit tests.

#### test_arbitrary_fn.py
This file contains a unit test for the `DocstoreFn` class's `search` method in the `arbitrary_fn` module. The test checks if a document is found and its content is correct by using a dummy dictionary.
