The `spark` directory is for creating and working with Spark agents in the Langchain application. It contains an entry point file, a base file for creating Spark agents, and a prompt file for prompting users with instructions and questions when working with a Spark dataframe.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file is the entry point for the Spark toolkit in the langchain/agents/agent_toolkits directory.

#### base.py
This file contains a function that creates a Spark agent from a dataframe and an LLM, and returns an instance of `AgentExecutor` class. It checks if Spark is installed and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. The function takes in various arguments such as `df`, `llm`, `callback_manager`, and `kwargs`, and uses them to create the agent.

#### prompt.py
This file contains a Python script that defines two string constants `PREFIX` and `SUFFIX`. These strings are used to prompt the user with instructions and questions when working with a Spark dataframe named `df`.
