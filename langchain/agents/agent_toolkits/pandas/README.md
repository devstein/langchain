The `pandas` directory is for creating and using a Pandas toolkit in the langchain/agents/agent_toolkits directory. It includes an entry point file, a base file with a function to construct a pandas agent, and a prompt file with a string prompt for users to answer questions about a pandas dataframe.

### Files
#### base.py
This file contains a function `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` that constructs a pandas agent from a language model and a dataframe. The function checks if the pandas package is installed and raises an error if it is not. It also generates a prompt for a ZeroShotAgent and sets up an LLMChain.

#### prompt.py
This file contains a Python script that defines a `PREFIX` and `SUFFIX` string used for prompting users to answer questions about a pandas dataframe named `df`. The script includes placeholders for the question prompt and the agent's scratchpad.
