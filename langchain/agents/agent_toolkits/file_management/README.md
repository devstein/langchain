The `file_management` directory is for providing a set of tools for interacting with the local filesystem. The `toolkit.py` file contains the `FileManagementToolkit` class, which offers a range of tools for copying, deleting, searching, moving, reading, and writing files, relative to a specified root directory. The `__init__.py` file imports the `FileManagementToolkit` class from `toolkit.py` and makes it available for use.
