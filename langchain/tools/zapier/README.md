The `zapier` directory is for tools related to using the Zapier Natural Language Actions API. It includes the `__init__.py` file for importing the `ZapierNLAListActions` and `ZapierNLARunAction` classes, the `prompt.py` file for providing a prompt for user input, and the `tool.py` file for executing specific actions and returning a list of exposed actions.

### Files
#### tool.py
This file contains the implementation of the Zapier Natural Language Actions API, which provides access to thousands of apps and actions on Zapier's platform through a natural language API interface. It includes a basic example of how to use NLA to find an email in Gmail, generate a draft reply, and send it to someone in Slack via direct message. Additionally, it contains the `ZapierNLARunAction` class, which is a tool for executing a specific Zapier action based on a natural language instruction string, and the `ZapierNLAListActions` class, which returns a list of all exposed user actions and a list of the user's exposed actions.
