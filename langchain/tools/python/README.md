The `python` directory is for implementing a Python REPL tool with input validation and sanitization, as well as default dictionaries for global and local variables. It includes two classes, `PythonREPLTool` and `PythonAstREPLTool`, which inherit from `BaseTool`. The former runs Python code synchronously, while the latter is not yet implemented.
