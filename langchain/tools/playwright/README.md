The `playwright` directory is for interacting with a web browser using Playwright. It includes tools for navigation, element extraction, clicking, and scraping hyperlinks and text from web pages. The directory contains several classes and functions, including a `BaseBrowserTool` class that serves as a base class for browser tools, and input schemas for each tool. The directory also includes a `utils.py` file with utility functions for the Playwright browser tools.
