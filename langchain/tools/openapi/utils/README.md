The `utils` directory is for utility functions and Pydantic models used for parsing and working with OpenAPI specifications. It includes functions for retrieving schemas, request bodies, and referenced parameters and schemas, as well as methods for getting valid HTTP methods for a specified path, getting the operation object for a given path and HTTP method, getting the components for a given operation, and getting the request body for a given operation. The directory also contains Pydantic models for API properties, request body properties, and API operations, as well as static methods for validating content, checking if a location is supported, and converting Python types to TypeScript types.
