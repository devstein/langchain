The `autonomous_agents` directory is for implementing autonomous agents that interact with the Auto-GPT model and a controller for these agents called `BabyAGI`. It contains the `autogpt` directory for defining the `AutoGPT` agent, its memory, output parser, prompt, and prompt generator, and the `baby_agi` directory for managing tasks, prioritizing them based on their objective, and executing them using a task creation chain, a task prioritization chain, and a task execution chain.

### Directories
#### autogpt
The `autogpt` directory is for implementing an autonomous agent that interacts with the Auto-GPT model. It contains files for defining the `AutoGPT` agent, its memory, output parser, prompt, and prompt generator.

#### baby_agi
The `baby_agi` directory is for implementing a controller for autonomous agents called `BabyAGI`. It includes methods for managing tasks, prioritizing them based on their objective, and executing them using a task creation chain, a task prioritization chain, and a task execution chain. The directory also contains files for the task creation, task execution, and task prioritization chains, which are used to generate tasks, execute tasks, and prioritize tasks, respectively.
