The `planners` directory is for implementing planners that generate plans to solve problems. It contains the `BasePlanner` and `LLMPlanner` classes for planning and executing actions based on input, as well as the `chat_planner.py` file which implements a chat planner that uses a language model to generate a plan from a system prompt.
