The `executors` directory is for implementing and defining classes that execute actions for agents and chains. It contains the `BaseExecutor` and `ChainExecutor` classes, which are used as base classes for other executors, and the `load_agent_executor` function, which loads a `StructuredChatAgent` and creates an `AgentExecutor` from it.
