The `docstore` directory is for implementing and providing different types of document stores. It includes an in-memory document store, a Wikipedia API wrapper, and a class for providing a Langchain Docstore via arbitrary lookup function. It also defines an abstract base class and a mixin class for accessing and adding documents to a document store. The `Document` class from the `langchain.schema` module is also exported from this directory.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file is the package initializer for the `docstore` directory. It imports and exposes the `InMemoryDocstore` and `Wikipedia` classes from their respective modules.

#### arbitrary_fn.py
This file contains the implementation of `DocstoreFn`, a class that provides a Langchain Docstore via arbitrary lookup function. This is useful when it's expensive to construct an InMemoryDocstore/dict, you retrieve documents from remote sources, or you just want to reuse existing objects. It includes a `search` method that returns a `Document` object.

#### base.py
This file defines an abstract base class `Docstore` and a mixin class `AddableMixin` for accessing and adding documents to a document store. The `Docstore` class defines an abstract method `search` for searching documents and returning either a page summary or a `Document` object. The `AddableMixin` class defines an abstract method `add` for adding more documents to the store.

#### document.py
This file exports the `Document` class from the `langchain.schema` module, making it available for use in other modules within the `docstore` directory.

#### in_memory.py
This file contains the implementation of an in-memory document store in the form of a dictionary. It includes methods to add documents to the dictionary and search for documents via direct lookup.

#### wikipedia.py
This file contains a wrapper around the Wikipedia API. It checks if the Wikipedia package is installed and provides a search function that returns either the summary and metadata of a page if it exists or a list of similar entries if it doesn't.
