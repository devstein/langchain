The `qa` directory is for evaluating and generating question answering functionality. It includes subclasses of LLMChain for evaluating question answering, PromptTemplate objects for grading student answers, and a specific LLM Chain for generating examples for question answering. There is also a Python script for generating a prompt for a teacher to create questions based on a given document.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file is the initialization file for the `langchain/evaluation/qa` directory. It imports and exports classes related to evaluating and generating question answering functionality, including `QAEvalChain`, `QAGenerateChain`, `ContextQAEvalChain`, and `CotQAEvalChain`.

#### eval_chain.py
This file contains multiple subclasses of LLMChain, specifically designed for evaluating question answering. It includes methods for loading the QA Eval Chain from a base language model, validating input variables, and evaluating question answering examples and predictions. The subclasses include `QAEvalChain`, `ContextQAEvalChain`, and `CotQAEvalChain`.

#### eval_prompt.py
This file contains Python code that defines two PromptTemplate objects for grading student answers to questions. One template is for grading based on factual accuracy only, while the other takes into account the context of the question. Both templates provide example formats and instructions for grading. The templates are designed to help teachers grade student answers to questions in a structured and consistent manner.

#### generate_chain.py
This file contains the implementation of `QAGenerateChain`, a specific LLM Chain used for generating examples for question answering. It imports `BaseLanguageModel` and `LLMChain` from other modules and defines a class method `from_llm` to load the QA Generate Chain from an LLM.

#### generate_prompt.py
This file contains a Python script that generates a prompt for a teacher to create questions based on a given document. The script uses a PromptTemplate to generate a template for the prompt, and a RegexParser to parse the output. The generated questions should be detailed and based on information in the document.
