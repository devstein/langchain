The `evaluation` directory is for evaluating and generating functionality related to language models. It includes loading datasets, evaluating ReAct style agents, evaluating and generating question answering functionality, and providing prompt templates for grading student answers.

### Files
#### __init__.py
This file contains a brief description of the `langchain/evaluation` directory and its purpose, which is to provide functionality related to evaluation.

#### loading.py
This file contains a function `load_dataset` that loads a dataset from a specified URI using the `datasets` library and returns a list of dictionaries containing the training data.

### Directories
#### agents
The `agents` directory is for evaluating ReAct style agents using a `TrajectoryEvalChain` class. It includes the implementation of the class in `trajectory_eval_chain.py` and a prompt template and code for evaluating an AI language model's trajectory in answering a user's question in `trajectory_eval_prompt.py`.

#### qa
The `qa` directory is for evaluating and generating question answering functionality. It includes subclasses of LLMChain for evaluating question answering, PromptTemplate objects for grading student answers, and a specific LLM Chain for generating examples for question answering. There is also a Python script for generating a prompt for a teacher to create questions based on a given document.
