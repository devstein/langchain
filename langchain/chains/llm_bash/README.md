The `llm_bash` directory is for implementing a chain that interprets prompts and executes bash code to perform bash operations. It includes initialization code, a `LLMBashChain` class for interpreting prompts and executing bash code, and a `BashOutputParser` class for parsing bash output.

### Files
#### base.py
This file defines the `LLMBashChain` class, a subclass of `BaseChain`, which interprets a prompt and executes bash code to perform bash operations. It includes methods for validating inputs and outputs, as well as a `_call` method that predicts the output of a given input using the `llm_chain` attribute.

#### prompt.py
This file contains the implementation of a BashOutputParser class that parses bash output. It also defines a PROMPT template that takes a question as input and provides a format for answering it with a series of bash commands. The PROMPT template uses the BashOutputParser to parse the output.
