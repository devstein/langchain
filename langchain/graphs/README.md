The `graphs` directory is for creating and manipulating graphs using NetworkX and Neo4j. It includes an initialization file that imports and exports the necessary classes, as well as a NetworkX wrapper file that provides functions for parsing knowledge triples, extracting entities, adding and deleting triples, retrieving information about entities, writing the graph to a GML file, and clearing the graph.

### Files
